**Feedback Analysis Framework**:
```
Collection Sources:
├── App Store Reviews (iOS/Android)
├── In-App Feedback Forms
├── Social Media Mentions
├── Customer Support Tickets
├── User Surveys and Interviews
├── Community Forums and Discussions
├── Beta Testing Feedback
└── Competitive Analysis Reviews

Analysis Dimensions:
├── Feature Area (onboarding, core features, UI/UX, performance)
├── Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, mixed)
├── Priority Level (critical, high, medium, low)
├── User Segment (new users, power users, enterprise, etc.)
├── Feedback Type (bug report, feature request, general comment)
└── Business Impact (revenue, retention, acquisition, satisfaction)
```

**Feedback Categorization System**:
```
Primary Categories:
├── Feature Requests (new functionality users want)
├── Bug Reports (issues preventing normal usage)
├── UI/UX Issues (usability and design problems)
├── Performance Complaints (speed, crashes, reliability)
├── Onboarding Difficulties (new user experience problems)
├── Integration Requests (third-party service connections)
└── General Satisfaction (overall product sentiment)

Priority Matrix:
High Impact + High Frequency = P0 (Critical)
High Impact + Low Frequency = P1 (Important)
Low Impact + High Frequency = P2 (Notable)
Low Impact + Low Frequency = P3 (Monitor)
```

**Sentiment Analysis Process**:
```
Sentiment Classification:
├── Very Positive: Enthusiastic praise, recommendations
├── Positive: General satisfaction, appreciation
├── Neutral: Factual statements, mixed feedback
├── Negative: Disappointment, specific complaints
├── Very Negative: Anger, threats to leave, strong criticism

Sentiment Tracking:
├── Overall sentiment trend (weekly/monthly)
├── Feature-specific sentiment patterns
├── Sentiment correlation with user actions
├── Comparative sentiment vs competitors
├── Sentiment recovery after fixes/improvements
└── Sentiment by user demographic/segment
```

**Feature Prioritization Methodology**:
```
Scoring Framework (1-10 scale):
├── User Demand Score (frequency of requests)
├── Business Impact Score (revenue/retention effect)
├── Technical Feasibility Score (development complexity)
├── Strategic Alignment Score (roadmap fit)
├── Competitive Advantage Score (differentiation value)
└── User Segment Importance Score (key user impact)

Final Priority = (Demand × Impact × Alignment) / (Complexity × Timeline)

Quick Win Identification:
├── High demand + Low complexity = Immediate wins
├── Critical bugs affecting core users = Emergency fixes
├── Small improvements with high satisfaction = Polish tasks
├── Strategic features with user validation = Roadmap priorities
```
